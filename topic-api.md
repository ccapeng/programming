# API

## API development
- Action
	- create/delete/update
	- set
		For example :
		`setProperty()`
	- get
		`str = getProperty()`
		Always return value. Avoid call be reference -- that just hard to trace.
	- to : `toUppoercase`
	- use : `useEffect()` //react
	- other verb : convert
- Condition
	- is : `isNew`
	- contains
	
- Avoid to have number in the function/method name

- Module
	- Just follow the others.  
		Most of package/module naming already have general practice.
	- Or if you want to classify your modules, just base on your visual of layers and groups. 


## How to start your code?


## Documentation
- markdown : for README and pure documentation.
	README.md is the general practice of your github project.

- API document
	- javadoc
	- jsdoc
	- python : docstring

## Open API and Swagger UI
- To be more efficient code, understand to use swagger API to create boilerplate codes.
